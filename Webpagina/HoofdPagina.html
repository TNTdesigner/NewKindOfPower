        The idea of the mod came when we were playing a homemade modpack, created by the main programmer Nico, who was very interrested in java coding and became in love <3.
        He wanted A modpack that would simulate the realworld elektronics but still had a little bit of fantasy in it,
        <div class="afbeelding"><img class="afbeelding" src="https://media-curse.cursecdn.com/attachments/154/436/8f286756fbab90e77dcfefb00606bae7.png"></div>so it would't get hard for people to understand and learn it, but would still feel like realworld electronics. So he asked a friend
        of him who was at that time a bit of an noob in 3D drawing but was very much interrested in evolving in to the bussnis
        to help him create the 3D moddels for his mod while he would code the working of it. a few months went by, school asked a lot of the friends and work stood still. Until! 1 year later, when TNTdesigner began with Github and invited a few more friends to help, and they started coding
        again. This time with a little more organised workspace. work whent well, sometimes TNTdesigner would code alone, sometimes with electrixx and Retro_Pixel, CmdPuritede would debug the lines of code, and when the time was ripe they asked for moddels and Reilif would diliver them.
